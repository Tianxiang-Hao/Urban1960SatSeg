Urban1960SatBench is a high-fidelity, city-scale semantic segmentation benchmark derived from declassified 1964 Keyhole (KH-4A) panchromatic satellite imagery co-registered with the 1965 official Xi’an urban distribution map. Through rigorous geo-referencing and expert manual annotation, the dataset provides pixel-level labels for impervious surfaces and four urban land-use categories (roads, buildings, water bodies and other urban types). Xi’an, as one of China’s oldest capitals, exhibits a unique juxtaposition of millennia-old cultural heritage and modern urbanization pressures. Consequently, Urban1960SatBench not only pioneers historical urban analysis using reconnaissance imagery but also establishes a challenging domain for segmentation models, owing to grayscale distortions and limited spatial resolution. This dataset facilitates studies in historical urban morphology reconstruction, cultural heritage conservation, and cross-temporal model generalization, offering a foundational resource for both Remote Sensing (RS) and Computer Vision (CV) communities.

### Model details will be announced soon...

## 📢 Reference & Statement
The architecture of the Model is mainly referenced from [Dino](https://github.com/facebookresearch/dino),[Dinov2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/dinov2), [SAM2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/sam2) and [Primaps](https://github.com/visinf/primaps). 

All experiments are carried out on NVIDIA 4090.

Urban1960SatSeg will be continuously updated to include additional locations, time periods, and other categories, supporting broader research on early urban development processes and image segmentation.
